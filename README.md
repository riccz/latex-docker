# Latex in Docker #

This is a simple Docker container for Latex.
It is supposed to be as similar as possible to a desktop installation of Tex Live, so it uses the distribution's packages.

The images are published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/riccz/latex-docker). 
Pull them using `docker pull riccz/latex-docker:impish`.
